The program reads the input.txt,checks the specified coordinates for correctness, in case of an error corrects them, executes a set of commands from the file, step by step, and produces output.txt. 
*`C` - Create Canvas: Should create a new canvas of width w and height h.  
*`L` - Create Line: Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.  
*`R` - Create Rectangle: Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.  
*`B` - Bucket Fill: Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "colour" c. The behavior of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs.
